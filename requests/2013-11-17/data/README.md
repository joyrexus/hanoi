The `converted` directory contains converted versions of the gesture samples
provided by Gwendolyn.  See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/joyrexus/7218817) for details on the conversion process.

Note that we simplified the naming of the leap data files.  For example, 
`data/1TOHF_05/1TOHF_05_exp1-1.json` is now `data/5/1-1.json`.
